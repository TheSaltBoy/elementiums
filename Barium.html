						<div class="headimg" id="barium"></div>
						<p>Barium is a soft silvery Alkaline Earth Metal. It's not found in nature, but can be found as compounds with other elements. The name Barium comes from the Greek 'barys' meaning "heavy."</p>

					<h2>Uses</h2>
					<div class="card">
						<div class="headimg" id="xray"></div>
						<p>One of the main uses of Barium is what's called a radiocontrast agent. Barium is inserted into the intestines of patients so doctors can better see them in an x-ray.
						<br><br>
						Barium doesn't have a lot of other industrial uses. It is sometimes used in electronics to create superconductors, and in fireworks to give them a green color.</p>

					<h2>History</h2>
					<div class="card">
						<div class="headimg" id="stone"></div>
						<p>People have known about Barium for a long time. Early chemists, known as Alchemists, found stones containing Barium in volcanic rock in Bologna, Italy. These stones, then called "Bologna Stones" would glow when exposed to light. Eventually mineral Barium became known as Baryte.
						<br><br>
						Many scientists in the 1700s hypothesized that Baryte contained a new element, but because of the difficulty of producing elemental Barium, these theories went unproven.
						<br><br>
						It wasn't until the invention of electrolysis that Barium could be extracted in a purer form. In 1808 Sir Humphry Davy isolated elemental Barium and gave it its modern name.</p>
