						<p>Helium is one of the simplest elements in the Periodic Table. It was discovered in 1895 and named after the Greek name for the Sun (Helios). Its Atomic Number is 2, and with an Atomic Weight of 4 it's one of the lightest elements. It's made up of only two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons. It doesn't react with any other elements (that's why it's called a Noble Gas).
						<br><br>
						There's not a lot of Helium in the atmosphere, most of it comes from natural gas fields and from other elements. It's the main product of Alpha Decay. One of the biggest concentrations of Helium in the Solar System is the Sun. Almost 1/3 of the Sun is entirely Helium!

							<p>You've probably blown up a balloon with Helium, or breathed it in to make your voice all squeaky, but there are a lot of other uses for Helium!
							<br><br>
							One of the main uses for Helium is in MRI machines in hospitals. Liquid Helium is so cold it's used to cool down the superconductor magnets in the MRI machines. Because it's so good at cooling, it's even used to cool down rocket engines!
							<br><br>
							Helium is lighter than the air we breath, so, just like with balloons, it's used to make blimps and airships float.
							<br><br>
							If you cool down Helium enough, it starts to do some weird things. We call cooled Helium, Helium II, a superfluid. Scientists are still learning about what makes this super cold liquid special.

					<h2>History</h2>

						<p>Helium was first observed in 1868 during a solar eclipse by French astronomer Jules Janssen. He noticed a bright yellow line in the spectrum of the sun. At first he thought it was Sodium, but another astronomer Norman Lockyer also observed the same thing. Lockyer named the element Helios, the greek name for the Sun.
						<br><br>
						For years scientists thought this new element could only be found in the Sun. But in 1895 Sir William Ramsay officially discovered Helium here on Earth. By testing a form of Uranium he was looking to find Argon, but ended up finding Helium.
						<br><br>
						For a long time people thought Helium was much rarer than it is. In 1903 a natural gas desposit was found with a portion of unknown gas. Upon closer inspection it was found to contain around 2% Helium. The natural gas fields in the US are to this day one of the largest producers of Helium in the world.
