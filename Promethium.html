					<h2>About</h2>
					<div class="card">
						<div class="headimg" id="promethium"></div>
						<p>Promethium is an element with an explosive history. It's name is derived from the Greek myth of Prometheus, the titan who stole fire from the gods. It was supposed to symbolize the "daring and possible misuse of mankind's intellect".
						<br><br>
						Very little Promethium exists naturally on earth. It's produced as a result of radioactive decay or Europium and Uranium.</p>

					<h2>Uses</h2>
					<div class="card">
							<div class="headimg" id="signal"></div>
							<p>Most Promethium is only used for research, but one isotope, Promethium-147 is used outside of the lab.
						<br><br>
						Promethium-147 is used in signal lights. The radiation emitted from the element lights up another material known as a phosphor. Promethium is useful in that it doesn't dmage or decay the phosphor material, so the light can shine for years at a time.</p>

					<h2>History</h2>
					<div class="card">
						<div class="headimg" id="fission"></div>
						<p>Scientists in the 1900s predicted that an as-of-then unknown element existed with properties between that of Neodymium and Samarium.
						<br><br>
						A few different researches claimed to have discovered this new mysterious element, one in Florence, Italy, which they called "Florentium"; and another at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which they called "Illinium". Both of these turned out not to be Promethium.
						<br><br>
						It wasn't until 1945 that Promethium metal was succesfully created. It was produced as a result of nuclear fission of Uranium. In 1947 it was officially recognized. Originally it was given the name "Clintonium" which was later changed to the modern name "Promethium."</p>
